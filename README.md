So you're on Part 5 of Lab 8 and Heroku is exploding! You've come to the right place. This epic gamer guide was made by Daniel and Aidan.

First, follow the instructions of Lab 5 up to step 6. Once you're at step 6, do the following:

1) Create a file called `requirements.txt` and add the following code:

```
gunicorn==20.1.0
Flask==2.2.0
```

2) Create a file called `.gitignore` and add the following code:

```
venv/
```
